### Step 6: Wrap Up
[] Push all commits
[] Briefly summarize if had more time
[] Update README - Trade-offs

## Trade-offs, Design Choices, Future Improvements
- I chose to start the project using the T3 stack to leverage its opinionated, full-stack, and type-safe foundation. This significantly accelerated my initial setup and development velocity by providing a pre-configured architecture with SQLite, Next.js, and TypeScript.

- I chose SQLite for its simplicity and zero-configuration setup, which was ideal for rapid prototyping. The trade-off was the lack of native JSON type support, which required me to serialize my options data into a string, but I was more than happy to accept this trade-off given constraints.

- I didn't exactly choose Next.js, as it's the default within the T3 stack, but the monolithic approach simplified my development workflow and dependency management, compared to maintaining separate front-end and back-end repositories. My familiarity with the Pages Router allowed for rapid implementation of both API routes and client-side pages, even if I ran out of time at the end.

- I chose to start my development process with a focus on data modeling in Prisma. Defining the schema and relationships first provided a clear "source of truth" for the application's data. I really like this approach because it clarifies the application's requirements upfront and makes it easier to design components and APIs that align directly with the underlying data structures.

Future Improvements: 
- Handle form validation, user auth, and would have liked to finish the review submission page.
